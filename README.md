# business-analysis-prolongations

This is a business analysis project in Python that helps to determine which managers can prolong their projects after completion and which cannot. I analysed the given data, introduced several new business metrics and created visualizations. For the above-mentioned pusposes I used join, filtration, heatmaps, and many more.
